 * The application frame: the sidebar on the canvas, and beside it the sheet

 * `Topbar` goes at the top of the sheet, as its first child.
 *
 * The inset is the hierarchy. The canvas around the edge is the application;
 * the sheet is the page. Nothing else is needed to say which is which, so the
 * sidebar carries no border and no fill of its own.
 *
 * On a phone the sheet goes edge to edge: 8 px of frame on a 375 px screen is
 * 4 % of the width spent on a border.
 *
 * It occupies exactly the window and the only thing that scrolls is the
 * content. An error tracker is a place you spend the day jumping between a list
 * and a record, and having the navigation scroll away while you read down a
 * thousand events means scrolling back up to leave.
 *
 * `h-dvh` and not `h-screen`: on a phone the browser chrome appears and
 * disappears as you scroll, and with `vh` the last row of a list sits
 * permanently underneath it.
 *
 * It brings the tooltip provider with it, because the collapsed sidebar depends
 * on it: without a provider, running down a rail of seven icons means waiting
 * out the full delay seven times.
